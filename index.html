            -This visual archive is my way of documenting New York City and various things I have made contact with while living and studying here.
            <br>
            -As an artist and student interested in visualised and creative works, I seek to make my work using the method of image manipulations.
            <br>
            -Colors, patterns, typography, and dimensions are what craft my own visual archive here and with proper use of them we can generate surprising and phenomenal works.
            <br>
            -Bringing the archive online is a perfect way for others to see my work through my lenses of perception with one simple click anywhere and at anytime.
